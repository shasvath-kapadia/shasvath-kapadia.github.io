---

I grew up in the coastal town of Pondicherry (now Puducherry). I studied at the Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education (SAICE), with a focus on physics and mathematics during college (2003-2006). I got my Masters degree in physics from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi (2007-2009). I then acquired a PhD degree from the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville (2010-2016), AR, USA, supervised by Prof. Daniel Kennefick. I subsequently held two postdoctoral positions. The first was at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee (UWM), USA, where I worked primarily with Prof. Jolien Creighton and Prof. Patrick Brady. The second was a Simons prize fellowship at the International Centre for the Theoretical Sciences (ICTS-TIFR), Bangalore, where I collaborated primarily with the Astrophysical Relativity group led by Prof. Parameswaran Ajith. I recently (May 2022) joined as an Assistant Professor at The Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune.

During my PhD, I spent several months interning at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Hannover, Germany. I collaborated there with Prof. Thomas Dent, Prof. Tito Dal Canton, and Prof. Badri Krishnan.

# About My Research

Most of my research concerns gravitational-wave astronomy, with a special focus on how GWs can inform and enrich other topics in astrophysics, cosmology and fundamental physics.
