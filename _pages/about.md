I'm an Assistant Professor at The Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), located in Pune, India. Most of my research concerns gravitational-wave astronomy, with a special focus on how GWs can inform and enrich other topics in astrophysics, cosmology and fundamental physics.
