I grew up in the coastal town of Pondicherry (now Puducherry). I studied at the Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education (SAICE), with a special focus on physics and mathermatics during college (2003-2006). I got my Masters degree in physics from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi (2007-2009), followed by a PhD degree at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville (2010-2016) supervised by Prof. Daniel Kennefick. I then held two postdoctoral positions. The first was at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee (UWM), where I worked primarily with Prof. Jolien Creighton and Prof. Patrick Brady. The second was a Simons prize fellowship at the International Centre for the Theoretical Sciences (ICTS-TIFR), where I collaborated primarily with Astrophysical Relativity group led by Prof. Parameswaran Ajith. Iâ€™m currently an Assistant Professor at The Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), located in Pune, India.

During my PhD, I also spent several months interning at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Hannover, Germany. I collaborated there with Prof. Thomas Dent, Prof. Tito Dal Canton, and Prof. Badri Krishnan.

# About My Research

Most of my research concerns gravitational-wave astronomy, with a special focus on how GWs can inform and enrich other topics in astrophysics, cosmology and fundamental physics.
