# About Gravitational Waves

Gravitational Waves are a prediction of Einstein's General Relativity (i.e, his theory of gravitation). GR stitches together space and time into a single fabric called spacetime. Unlike Newtonian physics where spacetime is a passive canvas on which the dynamics of the Universe plays itself out, GR asserts that spacetime is in fact an active participant. Agglomerations of matter and energy warp and curve the fabric of spacetime, and the geometry of spacetime determines the trajectory of objects in the vicinity of these agglomerations.

If that is not amazing enough, GR further predicts that spacetime can also "ripple". When massive objects accelerate, they produce these ripples in spacetime that we call gravitational-waves (GWs). They are, however, extremely weak, and therefore notoriously difficult to detect. For example, binary black holes orbiting their mutual centre of mass produce GWs. These GWs travel billions of light years (the exact distance depends on the location of the source) before they reach the Earth. Their effect on a kilometer long object is to stretch and squeeze it by an amount that's smaller than the radius of the nucleus of an atom!

Detecting GWs is therefore a monumental challenge. Nevertheless, the LIGO-Virgo network of ground-based interferometric detectors have been detecting them since 2015, and has thus opened a new window to the Universe, and a new branch of Astronomy, viz., GW-Astronomy. The vast majority of the GW events detected so far (as of May 2022) have been binary black hole mergers, although merging binary neutron stars and neutron star black hole binaries have also been observed. In fact, arguably the most spectacular detection so far occurred on August 17, 2017, when the merger of a binary neutron star produced both GWs and light (Electromagnetic Waves across a range of frequencies). LIGO-Virgo detected the GWs, and announced this detection to astronomers worldwide, who then followed it up with various telescopes. If memory serves, this is the most followed-up astronomical transient event in recorded history.

Other sources of GWs are also predicted, but remain to be observed (as of May 2022), including (but not limited to) a stochastic GW background produced by unresolved compact binary merger events, continous GWs from isolated spinning neutron stars, and bursts of GWs from exploding stars called supernovae.
